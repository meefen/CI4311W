## Course Description & Outcomes

Technology is pervasive in contemporary society, affecting virtually every facet of human existence.  It is commonplace in homes.  It has transformed work and communities, and even impacted the meaning of the word *community*.  It has made the world smaller through advances in communication and afforded new ways to interact with others – think of email, social media and free real-time video chat.  Despite the fact that it is so central to our lives, we often take technology for granted.  Technology as a broad subject is often thought of only as "computers", ignoring phones, vehicles, or design methods -- and we seldom have an opportunity to reflect upon these influences in our lives.  This course is designed to encourage such reflection by inviting you into a deeper discourse on technology, its impacts, and what relationship ethics has to technology and society.  

Liberal education (LE) is an essential part of your educational experience at the University of Minnesota. LE courses help you investigate the world from new perspectives, learn ways of thinking that will be useful to you in many areas of your life, and grow as an active citizen and lifelong learner.  This course fulfills the LE Civic Life and Ethics Theme requirement and is premised upon the assumption that good citizenship calls for a critical understanding of technology as it impacts us in our day-to-day world.  The course’s design explores, analyzes, and critically examines the uses of technology in education, global society, and the lives of individuals.  Many advancing technologies, such as the Internet, present tremendous value to improve peoples’ lives across the globe.  It is shortsighted to ignore potential threats that unethical use or misuse of technology bring in terms of cultural impacts, equity of distribution/access to knowledge, and on the rights of individuals (e.g. privacy and the potential for abuse of personal data).  The course’s design enables a learning experience that values and challenges each individual’s prior knowledge, while encouraging critical reflection upon the relationships that learners see and discover between technological innovations, the lives of individuals, and implications for our global society.

To facilitate your understanding of relevant readings and concepts, meaningful connections to your real life are enabled through the use of actual news stories and case studies drawn from various media.  Course activities provide intentionally designed opportunities for critical inquiry through multiple viewpoints and independent thinking while encouraging authentic learning and self-expression in a mutually respectful climate.  You should consider yourself enabled to apply your growing knowledge through multimedia presentations, essays, and interactive group discussions.  Demonstration of mutual respect inside and outside the class involves students communicating your viewpoints in a democratic, respectful manner as well as doing original work with proper attribution of the references cited.

You will be guided towards, and supported in, the development of your own informed opinions and positions on contemporary issues that:

- Ground the ethical use and development of technology within historical contexts;
- Examine the proposition of looking at technology through ethical lenses;
- Examine ontological impacts of technology on human existence;
- Examine ideas surrounding digital citizenship;
- Examine ethical issues raised in specific cases of technology use gone awry;
- Debate the prospect of limits on technology; and
- Discuss considerations surrounding technological innovation in a global society.

## Course Web Site

You will be responsible for becoming familiar with the course website, as this will be our means of interacting and communicating throughout the course.  The website is hosted on [Canvas](https://umn.instructure.com/courses/540). (Before your first access of the site, you may need to respond to an invitation sent to whatever email address you used to register with MyU.) Please bookmark the site address in your browser.

Some of you may have used Moodle, Blackboard or other online course management sites before. I am moving the course into Canvas to enable ongoing conversations and social interactions between and among all of us, while also providing an easy way to access grades, use a Calendar, and enable group discussions. To become familiar with this new technology, take a [Canvas student tour](https://umn.instructure.com/courses/54).

## Course Structure

### Textbook

There is no required textbook that you must purchase for this course.

### Readings

This course requires intensive reading.  All of the readings will be provided and available for you via our course website; however, a limited number of readings will be available at any one time.  The readings noted below in the syllabus should all be considered as subject to change; with the rapid pace of change inherent to technology, it may work best to use brand new material unavailable at the time of this writing.

### Class Sessions

This course is scheduled to meet online only.  There will be no required, in person face-to-face sessions.  Please be aware that there will be multiple assignments in order to complete the requirements for this *writing-intensive* course. Our learning together in this online community will be fun and highly interactive, but it does require that you are very self-motivated in order to stay on top of assignments and coursework. First, you will respond to questions and interact with your classmates based on new readings that will be assigned each class (there will be 14 "class sessions") using various online tools that will be explained to you. Additionally, you will have a list of the main writing assignments, which you can continue to work on until each one is complete and submitted.  There is a due date for each of these writing assignments to keep you on track.

### Student Internet Access

This course will require that you have ready and reliable access to the Internet for all communications and course work.  All registered University of Minnesota students are currently provided an e-mail address and you should either use it consistently or have it forwarded to the email address you regularly use.  We will be communicating throughout the course both via the course website and email.

### Technology

You will need to become very well versed with several technology applications for this course.

First of all, We will be using Canvas for our course website. As part of the University of Minnesota’s ongoing mission to review and evaluate emerging instructional technology, the University of Minnesota is conducting a pilot to assess Canvas as a learning management system (LMS). Our Spring 2016 class section is part of a small pilot and will use the Canvas learning management system (instead of Moodle).  

Since this is a pilot, you will not be able to find Canvas through your MyU account. You may wish to add the Canvas login link to your bookmarks/favorites: [https://umn.instructure.com](https://umn.instructure.com)  Our weekly discussions will take place primarily through discussion forum in Canvas, so please make yourself familiar with its functionalities.

If you need help using Canvas, here are some resources:
- [Getting started with Canvas guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ev4biQGpw4TqnNc8JhzLy1FohSGIGOEX4m8zaKeBm7A/edit#bookmark=id.tsola6hjhex)
- [Canvas tutorial videos](https://umn.instructure.com/courses/54/pages/canvas-student-tour-videos)

You will also need to be able to understand and implement hypermedia software (i.e., Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft PowerPoint, and/or Google Docs).

Additionally, we will use [FlipGrid](http://flipgrid.com/info/), a video-based messaging system, periodically. Please ensure you have consistent access to a webcam, microphone and are comfortable with their use.  It is worth noting that there is now a free iOS FlipGrid app which you are welcome to use.


## Class Participation

Active engagement in interactions with your peers is essential for meaningful learning to occur in the online environment.  I will be encouraging such interactions through various discussion assignments based on the readings. I, as the instructor, may post weekly questions related to the readings. But you, as the owner of your own learning, are expected to take a proactive role in initiating and sustaining conversations with the class as a community. Your meaningful participation is key in order to receive full credit.

*Assignments and Grades (All assignments are subject to change!)*

- CI 2311W is established as a *critique and analysis* of values and ethical issues related to technology and its role in society.   Since this course is writing intensive, it will require that your written work reflect sound evidence of such personal introductory exploration or critique.  Please see "Class Assignment Overviews" for additional details on differences in assignment requirements.

## Class Assignment Overview

### 1. Class Discussions/Reactions to Course Readings

Your consistently active, engaged participation within this class is of utmost importance.  Active class participation and contribution is necessary for full credit.  To be of the useful and valuable for you, informed opinions are requisite.  It will be important for us to allow each member of the class to express views, even when such views are not in accord with our own.  You are cautioned to use good taste and judgment with respect to what is stated or presented in class.  It is very important that you participate in each discussion AFTER completing your readings with an open mind for discussing and debating the many issues within.  If you keep up with the readings and engage fully in the discussions, you will have the best experience!

During class discussion, reflective, thoughtful debates of groups with alternative perspectives will be encouraged as a dynamic interchange of ideas and viewpoints occurs in a communicative, democratic environment.  Thoughtful, democratic, respectful debate will be a common occurrence throughout the course.

Meanwhile, I encourage you consider our class as a learning community, in which discussion is a means for the community to become more knowledgeable as a collective. Debates are not carried out for winning, but to build more advanced knowledge together.

**Please consider Mondays and Thursdays as our official course "meeting days" just like you would if this were a Face to Face course. (We are "meeting" twice instead of once a week because it is a summer course.) As such, all of our class discussions/reflections will be due by 6:00PM EACH Monday/Thursday unless otherwise noted.**

### 2. Writing Projects

This is a writing intensive course, so you will engage with writing projects related to technology & ethics. As an overall requirement, you are expected to **critically engage with course readings** when writing the topic(s) you choose. Example topics will be provided, and you’re encouraged to come up with something on your own.

Additionally, there is a new **peer review** aspect to the course. This is to facilitate deeper discussions between you and another student, and provide an opportunity to practice another variation of ethical behavior in an online environment. A really nice video about being a Peer Reviewer can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlSCMx9-fGA), and I’d recommend watching it even if you’ve been a peer reviewer before. For each writing project, you will be assigned a peer reviewer from our course roster.

**General submission guidelines**: 

- All writing assignments in this course should follow the **APA Style**. For your convenience, I recommend using the [Word template](http://www.siue.edu/~prose/classes/APAFormatTemplate.doc) or the [Google Doc template](https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=1cWBJYL0BbVocbSmFDMz2_440Wp3fIYLZs50QHbu2UiY&mode=public) as your starting point.
- Submissions are requested as Word document (.doc or .docx) or PDF file types. Please ensure the file is saved as [yourlastname][firstinitial]\_ProjectN\_[course number]\_[section number].  For example, if I were submitting the first paper, it might be ChenB_Project1_CI2311_001.pdf or .docx.
- Length: Essays should be 3-4 pages long (no longer) written in  the APA Style. Please include a title, abstract, and reference page---but these do not count in your 3-4 pages. In-text citations and a formal reference list in the APA format are an important part of your papers.


#### 2.1. Initial Exploration: Critical Analysis of Technology & Ethics in Pop Culture

Artifacts of pop culture (in this case, movies!) are fertile ground for an in-depth examination of various issues within technology &ethics. From George Lucas' first motion picture THX-1138 (released in 1971) to the more recent release of Disney’s Wall-E (2008), one could argue that science fiction isn’t about science at all; it is about people... and how they cope with concerns raised by technological advancement and the ethical choices they have to make.

As a creative means to explore the ethics of emerging technologies, you will conduct a critical analysis of one movie/motion picture film that encompasses some form of technology and communicate your analysis in the form of a written essay.

In your paper you will explore the ethical concerns that are raised by particular technologies depicted in the film of your choice and the potential implications for society.  Some examples of appropriate films for analysis are listed below; OR you may choose a movie on your own, as long as it meets the premise criteria outlined above. It is expected that each student will rent or borrow (from the library or a friend) a copy of the movie they choose in order to view it in its entirety to complete this assignment. Contact me if you are not sure if your movie works for this assignment.

- The Island
- Source Code
- Metropolis
- Hackers
- A.I.
- THX-1138
- Sneakers
- I Am Legend
- Minority Report
- I, Robot
- GATTACA
- Wall-E
- Inception
- District 9
- Watchmen
- The Avengers
- Iron Man
- Robocop
- Prometheus
- Man of Steel
- Total Recall
- Transformers
- Limitless
- Jumper
- Avatar
- Bicentennial Man
- My Sister’s Keeper
- Tron Legacy
- Up in the Air
- War Games
- Looper
- Total Recall
- Prometheus
			

**[IMPORTANT]**: Throughout your paper, you will be expected to make connections between issues raised in the film and the basic ethical theories we have been learning about. You are expected to **draw at least two references** from our first five course readings/discussions in meaningful ways. For example, our reading -- “Ethical principles, reasoning and decision making” by Budinger & Budinger (2006) –- provides an overview of basic ethical theories and moral principles and could be referenced. You may have other references as well from our other readings, or ones you find on your own. You will also be expected to critically reflect on the potential concerns for society as you see them.


#### 2.2. Continuing Exploration Project on a Topic of Your Choice

This second project is designed to provide you an opportunity to continue engaging with your topic, although in a fresh context of readings and discussions from between classes 6 through 12. While you are not strictly required to stick to the same topic as the initial project, it is highly encouraged.  You are welcomed to either write a paper or develop a multimedia project.  All of the prior requirements remain, including peer review as in the initial project, but with a few changes (in **bold**, below):

1. You can elect to author an essay, like what you did for the Initial Project.   
2.	Develop a multimedia project that better demonstrates your thinking about the topic at hand and/or adds to the viewer’s experience of your topic. However, this is a writing course, so keep that in mind as you consider the requirements:
  1. These projects could take the form of a staged debate between two people, a video, original artwork, original music or others.
  2. The project **must** be accompanied by a script, complete with citations, a reference list, and a reflection of your depth of understanding and thinking on the topic.
  3. You are encouraged to use graphics or mixed media – but be sure to cite the sources you draw from in appropriate APA style.

**Regardless of format, you will be required to:**

1.	Show how the peer review process was engaged, and how it informed the submitted project
2.	Be sure to draw at least two new references from our course readings/discussions **in sessions 6 through 11, and still do so in meaningful ways.  Note that this excludes the readings and discussions from the first 5 weeks.**

### Grading System

**Definition of Grades**

- A - achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements. YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THIS LEVEL OF WORK. Period.
- B - achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements.
- C - achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.
- D - achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements.
- S - achievement that is satisfactory, which is equivalent to a C- or better (achievement required for an S is at the discretion of the instructor but may be no lower than equivalent to a C-.)
- F(or N) - Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I).

The grading for this course is as follows:


| Grade   | Percentage          |
|----|-----------|
| **A**  | 94 – 100% |
| A- | 90 – 93%  |
| B+ | 87 – 89%  |
| **B**  | 84 – 86%  |
| B- | 80 – 83%  |
| C+ | 77 – 79% |
| **C**  | 74 – 76% |
| C- | 70 – 73% |
| D+ | 67 – 69% |
| **D**  | 64 – 66% |
| D- | 60 – 63% |
| **F** | Below 60% |

It is worth noting here that the structure of this course is more about your learning than it is about a grade.  You are each capable of "A" work, and it is my assumption everyone starts with an "A".  It is ultimately up to you to prove me wrong.  

You will be provided feedback to help guide you to more resources, areas where you can improve, and aspects you are doing well in.  This feedback will typically be in the form of text- or audio-formats.  I will only communicate what your grade is upon request.  

**Academic Dishonesty**

Academic dishonesty in any portion of the academic work for a course shall be grounds for awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course.

**Incomplete Grades:**

The grade of "I" is not a regular University grade and cannot be given without **special arrangements under unusual circumstances**.  It cannot be given merely to extend the time allowed to complete course requirements.  If family or personal emergency requires that your attention be diverted from the course and that more time than usual is needed to complete course work, arrangements should be made with the instructor of the course before the quarter ends and consent obtained for receiving an "Incomplete" or "I" grade.  These arrangements should be made as soon as the need for an "I" can be anticipated.  A written agreement should be prepared indicating when the course assignment will be completed.  Normally an "Incomplete" grade for a course should be removed within one quarter of its receipt.

**Receipt of Final Grade:**

University policies do not permit the posting of final course grades nor the reporting of these grades over the telephone.  If you would like a record of your course grade before it is available via the University web site, provide a self-addressed stamped envelope to the instructor at some point prior to the last class session.

**Feedback on projects:**

During the course, feedback will be returned to students as soon as possible via our course website or email.  I reserve the right to return your project with an expectation of your re-doing it to better reflect your best work.

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students.  The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.

- If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical), please contact the DRC at 612-626-1333 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.
- If you are registered with the DRC and have a current letter requesting reasonable accommodations, we encourage you to contact your instructor early in the semester to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course.

Additional information is available on the DRC website: https://diversity.umn.edu/disability/

### Mental Health

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.  You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu
