Great Class 3 discussions!
========================================================

- "ethics raises hard questions and that there is rarely one right answer"
- "no optimal answer to these ethical problems, but being aware of the guiding concepts and knowing how to design solutions would definitely help when making decisions."
- "constructs of ethics are not mutually exclusive, and using a single model does not accurately capture the picture of ethics"
- "we will have to use the tools, the four A's for designing solutions to ethical problems"
- but "this [4A] strategy has its limitations"
- ...

<!-- - "Which, if any, did you seem to personally identify with? If none of them seemed to encompass everything to you, how would you explain your own view?"-->
